# Reading. 

Read as much as you can possibly get away with. At first, it scarcely matters
what you read. I have read so many works of cheap fiction that I cannot
ennumerate them. And if nothing else, they were all practice. Also, don't think
that entertainment or diversion is a small thing. Life can be very difficult
sometimes. And to create something that can take a person away from their
troubles, and lighten their burden even for just a few hours, is an honorable
and noble thing. We all need a break. And anything that lets you return to a
struggle with renewed energy, that is worth praise. 

Also, always remember the words of G.K. Chesterson -- The opposite of funny is
not serious. The opposite of funny is not funny and nothing else. In fact, the
most difficult subjects, the most important things and extreme moments in your
life will come with inherent humor. It helps us to handle difficult things.
There is more wisdom about race in U.S. in Blazing Saddles than there is in a
semester's worth of diversity training. 

To put it another way. There is a joke that goes When Groucho Marx was told that he and his family
couldn't go into a pool because he was Jewish -- he quipped, my kids are only
half Jewish, can they go in up to their waist? For me, that's more effective at
exposing the stupidity of racism than many, deadly serious volumes of writing
could ever be. 

In comedy, there is genius. 


Right now I read about fifty books
a year. If life goes in a pleasing direction, this number will go up. But as I
can see the end of my life from where I sit, I can see that this number is
finite. And have I have started to have some care for which books I take time
with. 

I attempt a only a few truly great books a year. No more than one Russian
Novel, for example. But by great, I mean that they are books that have real
depth and numinous quality. These are books that change people. And real change
doesn't happen on the frenetic timeline of the moder world. It takes time and
thought and effort to digest things and integrate them into your personality.
It's work worth doing, but you can't rush it. 

I read the Bible continuously. It is most correct to say of me that I wrestle
with God, more than fervently believe in any religion, but that has little to do
with the attention I pay to the Book. It contains some of the deepest
foundations of Western Civilization -- and the fate of the world itself seems to be
knotted up in inexorably in the Old Testament, if for no other reason than
Judaism, Christianity and Islam all claim it as scripture. A great deal of the
formal power of the English language comes from the Bible. After that, I suppose, 
Shakespeare. So I read the Bard also.   

There are many "intellectuals" today who would just as soon forget the Bible
and would mock my suggestion. But I can't see that is an attitude that someone
who really wants to understand history or what it means to be human --
intertwined concerns in the humanities, certainly -- gets to adopt that stance.
Be ye athesist or evangelist, the Book is far to fundamental to ingore. As
evidenced by the Bible being known as THE book rather than A book. 

In your reading, do not rely too heavily upon pre-digested sources. They always
seem get it wrong -- especially
the news. For every genre or style or movement or idea, there was an initial
spark. Most of the time all that follows is a copy of a copy of
copy, degrading a little be each time. But there remains, in the initial work
of art or philosophy, some vital flame that it is worth lighting your own torch
from. 

For example, say that you find yourself liking cowboy stories. I myself love
them, and think that every great movie is inherently a Western. There's great
westerns and terrible westerns, but the form itself is illuminated by reading
The Virginian by Owen Wister. Effectively the first cowboy story. (Although,
one could make the case that the Leatherstocking Saga by James Fenimore Cooper,
could qualify as a western, even though I think it's really more of an Indian story)

Or say you like romance novels.
