# Reading. 

Read as much as you can possibly get away with. At first, it scarcely matters
what you read. I have read so many works of cheap fiction that I cannot
ennumerate them. And they were all practice. Right now I read about fifty books
a year. If life goes in a pleasing direction, this number will go up. But as I
can see the end of my life from where I sit, I can see that this number is
finite. And have I have started to have some care for which books I take time
with. 

I attempt a only a few truly great books a year. No more than one Russian
Novel, for example. But by great, I mean that they are books that have real
depth and numinous quality. These are books that change people. And real change
doesn't happen on the frenetic timeline of the moder world. It takes time and
thought and effort to digest things and integrate them into your personality.
It's work worth doing, but you can't rush it. 

I read the Bible continuously. It is most correct to say of me that I wrestle
with God, more than fervently believe in any religion, but that has little to do
with the attention I pay to the Book. It contains some of the deepest
foundations of Western Civilization -- and the fate of the world itself seems to be
knotted up in inexorably in the Old Testament, if for no other reason than
Judaism, Christianity and Islam all claim it as scripture. A great deal of the formal power of the English language comes
from the Bible. After that, I suppose, Shakespeare. So I read the Bard too.  

Do not rely upon pre-digested sources. They always get it wrong -- especially
the news. For every genre or style or movement or idea, there was an initial
spark that set it off. Most of the time all that follows is a copy of a copy of
copy, degrading a little be each time. But there remains, in the initial work
of art or philosophy, some vital spark that it is worth lighting your own fire
from.
