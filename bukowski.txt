There is a romantic idea in my head of Ol' Chuck Bukowski, drunken poetic
postman of the American Discontent, as being the true seeker. A shaman with a
power rattle made from empty beer bottles. Alone, but not lonely, irascible but
asetic in is persuit of words and flaggelation of the liver. 

The cliche of the writer and his bottle. 

But surely, this is not the only path to knowlege -- nor the only path to the
generation of text. 

Why not, mindful exercise, and the word? 

The most enjoyable period of reading in my life were a few summers spent in the
mountains. I would range out side, swim long distances in competition, and
collapse, exhausted onto my bed. I would read long into the night, sleep long
into the afternoon, then read long into the night again.
