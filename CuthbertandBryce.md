Batman as social justice warrior


* Cuthbert is a man in search of a good night's sleep. 
* Awoken in the middle of the night, because Bryce senses danger.
* Bryce is driving him NUTS.

An inconstant master. 

Cuthbert awoke early, shortly before dawn.  In an estate of this size, there was always much to do.

Prepared a full breakfast.

It was, Cuthbert had always thought, a good thing to be in service to one's
fellow man. And a good thing to be in service, or of use to, another man. Or,
person, as the gender neutral slant of these early days of the 21st century
would have it. But, at times, he wondered about being a Butler. 


Cuthbert? 


List of problems, Cuthbert can have:

* rescue the Lynx from his own peril.
* Get Bryce out of bed so he can get to a meeting.
* Is awoken in the middle of the night, because Bryce is a vigilante.
* Is squeezed between Vulp and The Warner Estate
* Vulp says, you're not going to have a job if he passes. Old butlers aren't
the fashion anymore, you see. Butlettes. Executive Assistants. 




Maybe Cuthbert isn't a badass at all? Maybe he's just a butler. 

I like just a butler, because he's got more obstacles. He wheezes when he goes
up and down stairs. He has gut. He's Jeeves, but wishes he could be the
gardener.
